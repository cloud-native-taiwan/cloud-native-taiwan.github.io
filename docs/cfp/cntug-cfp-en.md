## Important Notes

- All speakers are required to adhere to [CNCF Code of Conduct][2]
- `Avoid sales or marketing pitches and discussing unlicensed or potentially closed-source technologies` when preparing your proposal; these talks are almost always rejected due to the fact that they take away from the integrity of our events, and are rarely well-received by conference attendees.

## CODE OF CONDUCT

CNCF and its project communities are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants at our events. All submitters are required to abide by our [Code of Conduct][2]
