### Build and manage Wasm applications using container tools

講題簡介: 

Wasm has emerged as a secure, portable, lightweight, and high-performance runtime sandbox for cloud-native workloads such as microservices and serverless functions. We will show how familiar container tools can be used to develop and share Wasm applications.

Today, there is a large ecosystem of battle-tested tools to create, manage, and deploy Linux container apps in both dev and prod environments. Developers want to use the same tools to manage their Wasm applications to reduce the learning curve and operational risks. More importantly, using the same tools would allow Wasm containers to run side by side with Linux containers. That enables the architectural flexibility to run some workloads (eg lightweight, stateless, transactional, scalable) in Wasm containers, and other workloads (eg long running, heavyweight) in Linux containers.

In this talk, I will cover how to create, publish, share and deploy real-world Wasm applications using Docker Desktop, Podman, containerd, and various flavors of Kubernetes. The examples will feature mixed container types to showcase how Wasm containers work side by side with existing Linux container apps.

### Streamlining Microservices with Kong API Gateway: Simplifying Management and Enhancing Security

In a microservices architecture, client-side applications may be composed of dozens of different services. When handling external requests, each service must consider mechanisms such as authentication, authorization, caching, rate limiting, and more. Additionally, each service may use a different programming language and implementation approach, which can lead to increased development and management costs.

By adopting the API Gateway pattern, we can address these challenges. The API Gateway takes on the responsibility of handling request details, allowing services to focus on their business logic. Furthermore, managers can easily manage and monitor the running of APIs in the system through the API Gateway.

In this presentation, we will use Kong API Gateway as an example to demonstrate how to manage APIs and incorporate mechanisms such as authentication, authorization, caching, and rate limiting. We will also explore different architectural approaches with Kong and discuss their suitable use cases.

### A Comprehensive Guide to API Gateways, Kubernetes Gateways, and Service Meshes

There is still a lot of confusion about API gateways, Kubernetes gateways, and service meshes. A lot of this is because:

People often mention these technologies with the same keywords, like canary deployments, rate limiting, and service discovery.
All these technologies use reverse proxies.
Some API gateways have their own Kubernetes gateways and service meshes and vice versa.
There are a lot of articles/videos that compare the three technologies and conclude why one is better than the other.
In this talk, I will try to explain these technologies and share how they fundamentally differ and cater to different use cases.

### Deploy 1 thousand pods in my JUST laptop (w/ kwok)

Kubernetes is one of powerful tools for container orchestration.
In fact, it is really a matter of scheduling to manage container.
Thus sometimes we should test and demonstrate what we thought to deploy properly working before we deploy in the product.

However, mostly resource is limited to test it.
Therefore, KWOK(Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet) is really helpful to deploy & schedule purpose.
{https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kwok}
And furthermore if you could save the resource, it could archive for Environmental Sustainability
(https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability) as well!!!

So why don’t you start from today? 😃

### Strengthening Kubernetes Security

In this talk, we will be discussing the importance of securing your Kubernetes cluster and how you can do it using the powerful tool, “m9sweeper.” As the adoption of Kubernetes continues to grow, it has become more critical to prioritize the security of your cluster.

“M9sweeper” is an open-source security tool that is designed to detect and identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in your Kubernetes deployment. It offers a comprehensive set of checks that cover a broad range of security aspects, including network policies, access control, encryption, and pod security.

It has the potential of centralized monitoring of popular Kubernetes security tools Trivy, Gatekeeper, KubeSec, Kube-Hunter, Kube-bench, and Falco.

### Multi-Tenant ArgoCD in enterprise grade

As the company adopt more on Kubernetes, in order reduce the deployment effort, ArgoCD is introduced. During the introduction, the major challenge would be having DevOps teams to operate and mange while having distribution permission management with the context of compliance and security. The talk would go thought how to setup and extend ArgoCD to fulfill these requirement.

### Why we need a new deployment tool called Atmosphere?

In Vexxhost, we use Atmosphere to deploy all our production public clouds.

Atmosphere is an open-source solution that we develop to deploy OpenStack and Kubernetes.

After trying multiple deployment tools, we decide to build one by ourselves.

Now all of our public cloud and most of our private cloud are built and managed by Atmosphere.

In this session, we will share what’re the key points we try to resolve with Atmosphere.

Swe will share what’re the key points we try to resolve with Atmosphere.
And why other methods not working for us.

And further, I will dive into this tool, and share how you can build and run it by yourself.

And finally deep dive into the technical part.
